Game Of three App
------------------------------------------------------------
Description
<br>
When a player starts, it incepts a random (whole) number and sends it to the second
player as an approach of starting the game. The receiving player can now always choose 
between adding one of {-1, 0, 1} to get to a number that is divisible by 3. Divide it by three. The 
resulting whole number is then sent back to the original sender.
The same rules are applied until one player reaches the number 1(after the division).
